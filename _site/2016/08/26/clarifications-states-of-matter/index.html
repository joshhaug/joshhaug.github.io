At first glance, aerosols, vapors, and gases appear to be the same thing -- but there are subtle differences which cannot be observed with the human eye.  Here I'd like to clarify those differences and answer the most common questions about this topic.  
</div>

<h3 id="why-its-important">Why It’s Important</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Different processes of generation, different behaviors, different effects on our lungs, etc.</li>
  <li>Clarifies the differences between e-cigarettes, herbal vaporizers, and combustion</li>
  <li>The confusion is amplified by the e-cigarette industry’s use of terms for marketing that are not congruent with the science.</li>
  <li>Gives scientists a clue on how to allow scientific jargon to evolve
    <ul>
      <li>Vapor redefinition to the gaseous phase or suspension of a liquid</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="definitions">Definitions</h3>
<dl>
    <dt>Suspension</dt>
    <dd>A heterogeneous mixture containing solid particles that are sufficiently large for sedimentation. Diameter ≥ 1.0 µm.  The particles can be either solid or liquid. In theory, all suspensions settle.</dd>
      
    <dt>Aerosol</dt>
    <dd>A suspension of liquid droplets or fine solid particles in a gas. Particles can range from 1 to 10 µm in diameter.</dd>
        
    <dt>Colloid</dt> 
    <dd>Unlike suspensions, colloids do not settle.  Diameter &lt; 1.0 µm.  Kind of the gas version of a solution.</dd>    

    <dt>Vapor</dt>
    <dd>The gas phase of something that was once a liquid.  Colloquially refers to the aerosol produced by e-cigarettes and herbal vaporizers.</dd>
    
    <dt>Sublimation</dt>
    <dd>A phase change: solid → gas.</dd>
</dl>

<p>What e-cigarettes produce: aerosol (suspension of small droplets of propylene glycol + nicotine solution + flavoring solution)</p>

<p>What herbal vaporization produces: aerosol (small droplets of trichomes)</p>

<p>What combustion produces: 
Solid Aerosol</p>

<p>How are droplets suspended in the air?

<h3 id="aerosol-categorization">Aerosol Categorization</h3>

<p>Aerosols can be categorized by the measure of particle heterogeneity.  For instance, an aerosol can be <strong>monodisperse</strong> (all particles the same size – this one is very rare in nature) or <strong>polydisperse</strong> (many different sizes).  It’s useful to describe polydisperse aerosols with a distribution of particle sizes — simply divide the total size range into intervals and find the percent of particles that fall within each interval.  The two most common size intervals you’ll find in literature are PM-10 and PM-2.5.  These categories are convenient as they roughly describe where the particles would deposit, if inhaled by an adult human.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>PM-10</strong> is an abbreviation for “Particulate Matter of Aerodynamic Diameter ≤ 10.0 µm.”  These particles deposit in the mouth, throat, and upper parts of the lungs.</li>
  <li><strong>PM-2.5</strong> is therefore an abbreviation for “Particulate Matter of Aerodynamic Diameter ≤ 2.5 µm.”  These particles are in the danger zone, so to speak – they are small enough to reach the alveolar region of the lungs, where they can be effortlessly absorbed into the bloodstream.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="deposition">Deposition</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Deposition is the process by which aerosol particles deposit themselves on solid surfaces.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is caused by one or more of the following…</p>

<ul>
  <li>Impaction — some particles are unable to follow the curvature of the airflow due to their inertia, so they are flung out of the airstream and hit something</li>
  <li>Settling (aka gravitational sedimentation) — particles fall and settle due to gravity</li>
  <li>Interception — when following the streamline, some of the outermost particles will run into obstacles (note the difference between this and impaction, which is the result of a curvature in the air path)</li>
  <li>Turbulence —</li>
  <li>Thermophoresis</li>
  <li>Turbophoresis — tendency for particles to collect in the area of least turbulence</li>
  <li>Diffusiophoresis — spontaneous movement of particles caused by a concentration gradient</li>
  <li>Electrophoresis</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="respiratory-deposition">Respiratory Deposition</h3>

<p>The diameter of the particle dₚ determines the region in which it will deposit.  Size-selective sampling is generally split into the following categories:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Inhalable fraction: enters the nose, mouth, pharynx, larynx (dₚ &gt; 10.0 µm)</li>
  <li>Thoracic fraction: reaches the thorax/chest region, trachea to terminal bronchioles, corresponding to PM-10  (dₚ ≤ 10.0 µm)</li>
  <li>Respirable fraction: reaches the alveolar/pulmonary region, corresponding to PM-2.5  (dₚ ≤ 2.5 µm)</li>
</ul>

<p>The most important mechanisms of deposition in the respiratory system are impaction, settling, and diffusion.  Impaction is of primary concern in the large airways.  Settling is most important in the smaller airways and alveolar region.</p>

<p>￼</p>

<p>Breathing Statistics
Volume: At rest, about 0.5 L of tidal air is inhaled and exhaled with each breath. During heavy work, the tidal volume may exceed three times this amount. 
Rate: A resting adult breathes about 12 times a minute, a rate that triples (36 breaths/min) during heavy work.</p>

<h3 id="aerosol-behavior">Aerosol Behavior</h3>

<p>The aerodynamic diameter of a particle is the diameter of a spherical particle with the same settling velocity as the irregular particle.  This particle is assumed to have a density of 1000 kg/m^3.  It is defined as…</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">d_{a} = d_{e}\left(\frac{\rho_{p}}{\rho_{0}\chi}\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}</script>

<h3 id="measurement-techniques">Measurement Techniques</h3>

<p>Aerosol Mass Spectrometry — AMS
- Specifically the off-line variant, as the aerosol is collected before measurement</p>

<p>Particulate Matter Samplers
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particulate_matter_sampler 
- Inertial Separators
    - Purpose: eliminate particles outside of a desired size range
    - A gas stream is forced to turn a sharp corner, and the inertia of the large particles causes them to separate from the gas stream and attach to the walls of the vessel
    - Use a volumetric flow control system to pull air at the required velocity to achieve the desired cutpoint
    - Cyclonic Inertial Separators spin the gas stream
    - Impactor Inertial Separators involve a greased metal plate which the heavier particles collide with</p>
