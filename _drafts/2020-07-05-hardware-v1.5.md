In my [previous prototype](hardware.html), I used a thermocouple to measure the hive temp and an IR thermopile to measure the ambient temp. which was an apples-to-oranges comparison. With identical thermometers I'll get a better sense of the actual tempertaures inside and outside the hive.

Well, I just got some K-type thermocouples and MAX6675 breakout boards in the mail. It's like Christmas in July!

Here's a wiring diagram showing how the new MAX6675 breakouts are connected to the Raspberry Pi:

Note that I'm sharing the power (`VCC`), ground (`GND`), serial clock input (`SCK`) and serial data output (`SO`) lines across the three boards.  Each board has only one unique wire, going to the chip select (`CS`) pin.  This pin is active low according to the [datasheet](https://datasheets.maximintegrated.com/en/ds/MAX6675.pdf), so you need to set each board's GPIO pin to 0 (and the others to 1) before reading it. 

Each MAX6675 chip has a max current draw of 1.5mA, so we're well within the Pi's pin limit of 16mA.
