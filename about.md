<em>The world of the bee is like a magic well. 
<br>The more you draw from it, the more it fills with water.</em>

As a hobbyist beekeeper, I'm obsessed with the challenges bees face. And as a software engineer, I can't help but wonder how those challenges might be addressed by technology.

For instance, **what if inexpensive sensors could detect problems in your beehive in real time?** I've explored that concept with some prototypes. Check them out!

* [Version 2: A Little Better](hardware-v2.html)
* [Version 3: ESP32 Inside the Hive](hardware-v3.html)
* [Version 4: A Custom PCB!](hardware-v4.html)

Another question I've had: **what if computer vision could be used to track bees and measure pollination efficiency?** I've explored that too! Check it out:
* [An approach to inaccurately count bees](quick-video-analysis.html)
* [Training a CNN to count bees much more accurately](counting-bees-using-a-cnn.html)

This website is a work in progress, and a lot of the stuff I've worked on I haven't bothered to write about yet. But stay tuned! And thanks for reading.
