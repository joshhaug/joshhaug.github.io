In my [previous prototype](hardware.html), I used one thermocouple and one IR thermopile to measure the hive and ambient temperatures, respectively. But that was an apples-to-oranges comparison. With identical thermometry hardware, I should be able to get a better sense of the tempertaures inside and outside the hive.

Well, I just got some K-type thermocouples and MAX6675 breakout boards in the mail. It's like Christmas in July!

Here's a wiring diagram showing how the new MAX6675 breakouts are connected to the Raspberry Pi:

Note that I'm sharing the power (`VCC`), ground (`GND`), serial clock input (`SCK`) and serial data output (`SO`) lines across the three boards.  Each board has only one unique wire, going to the chip select (`CS`) pin.  This pin is active low according to the [datasheet](https://datasheets.maximintegrated.com/en/ds/MAX6675.pdf), so you need to set each board's GPIO pin to 0 (and the others to 1) before reading it.
