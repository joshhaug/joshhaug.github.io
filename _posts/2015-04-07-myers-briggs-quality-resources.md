This is the first in (what I hope will be) a series of Quality Resource compilations.

Many people find it difficult to learn concepts on their own.  Here’s something to think about: straightforward & factual resources should be shared whenever possible.  It’s the only way we’ll separate the wheat from the chaff.

* Applications of Myers-Briggs (and personality theory in general) to human-computer interaction
* Audiovisual folks might appreciate Michael Pierce's Sixteen Types
* Keirsey’s first and second works on the subject
