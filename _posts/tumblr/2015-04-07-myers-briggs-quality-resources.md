This is the first in (what I hope will be) a series of Quality Resource compilations.

Many people find it difficult to learn concepts on their own, which I take as a sign that many self-teaching materials are complete crap.  This is especially true of online materials. In my experience, most online resources written by beginners & for beginners are terrible; the one-eyed often prefer leading the blind to following the two-eyed.

Here’s my point: straightforward & factual resources should be shared whenever possible; that’s the only way we’ll be able to separate the wheat from the chaff.

Unusually accurate MBTI test 
Interesting text on the applications of Myers-Briggs (and personality theory in general) to human-computer interaction
For visual learners: Michael Pierce: Sixteen Types
Keirsey’s first and second definitive works on Jungian typology.
