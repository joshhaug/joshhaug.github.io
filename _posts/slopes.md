Slopes is an app for iPhone and iPad. It solves differential equations.  More than that, it graphs, simulates, and animates the system.  You can save systems, export graphs (even to pdfs), etc.  Many a diff eq student has struggled with visualising the movement of a spring-mass system without setting up a whole spring-mass apparatus.   It is designed with 5 activities.  I wrote this app with Dr. Timothy Lucas.  
Dr. Lucas is a professor of mathematics at Pepperdine.

Slopes is an interactive environment for exploring graphical solutions to ordinary differential equations.  Slopes consists of five activities with preloaded examples to get you started and the ability to input your own content. "Slopefields" and “Phase Planes” both plot vector fields and solutions corresponding to multiple initial conditions. “Systems” dynamically solves systems of up to six equations. “Waves” solves second-order constant coefficient equations animates the corresponding spring-mass system or RLC circuit. “Methods” constructs numerical approximations of a single ordinary differential equation using Euler’s method as well as Second and Fourth Order Runge-Kutta methods.  Slopes is a playground for ODEs.  You can use it for homework, in-class activities or a new research project.  Slopes is currently available for the iPad via the App Store.  We hope to expand to other platforms in the future.  


## Slopefields ##

The slopefields activity allows you to plot a family of solutions to a single differential equation y' = f(t,y).  The slope of an arrow located at the point (t,y) is given by f(t,y) and indicates the trajectory of a solution to the differential equation through that point.  The slopefield of a differential equation gives useful information about the general trends and stability of the solutions.  You can resize the window using pinch and pull gestures as well as add solutions by tapping on a point within the graph.  Enter your own equation or explore one of the preloaded equations.

## Phase planes ##

The phase planes activity allows you to plot a family of solutions to a system of two differential equations  x' = f(x,y) and y' = g(x,y).   The phase plane of a system gives a picture of how the solution y varies with respect to x which will allow you to see general trends and stability of the solutions. The slope of an arrow located at the point (x,y) is given by g(x,y)/f(x,y) and indicates the trajectory of a solution to the system through that point.  You can add solutions by tapping on a point within the graph   and the corresponding solutions x(t) and y(t) will appear in the small window in the lower left corner.  Watch an animation that traces the x(t) and y(t) solutions and the corresponding curve in the x-y plane. Enter your own system of equations or explore one of the preloaded systems.

## Systems ##

The systems activity allows you to plot the solutions to a system of up to six ordinary differential equations.  The initial condition for each equation can be input just to the right of the equation.  This activity is different from phase planes because it allows you the equations to explicitly depend on the independent variable t as well as the dependent variables x,y,z,u,v and w. You can resize the window using pinch and pull gestures as well as extend the solutions by panning with a single finger.  Enter your own equations or explore one of the preloaded systems.

## Waves ##

The waves activity allows you to plot the solutions to a second order differential equation with constant coefficients.  Since many of these equations can be interpreted as a spring-mass system or RLC circuit, the activity includes simulations that correspond to the solutions.
You can resize the window using pinch and pull gestures as well as extend the solutions by panning with a single finger.  Enter your own forcing term or explore one of the preloaded equations.

## Methods ##

The methods activity allows you to plot numerical approximations to the solution of an ordinary differential equation y'=f(t,y).  The methods employed in this activity are Euler's Method as well as Second and Fourth Order Runge-Kutta.  The activity includes a table of the approximations that correspond to each method.  You can easily toggle between the different methods as well as resize the window using pinch and pull gestures.  Enter your own equation or explore one of the preloaded equations.
