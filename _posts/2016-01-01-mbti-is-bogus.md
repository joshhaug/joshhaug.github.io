title: You Know MBTI is Bogus, Right?
---

I've heard that too.  Here's my take...

## Yes, Sort Of ##

* Classifying people's personalities is inherently ambiguous
* So it cannot be a (capital-t) Truth of Psychology
* I **despise** MBTI Trust速 for trademarking Myers-Briggs Type Indicator速, Myers Briggs速, and MBTI速.  [Yikes.](http://www.myersbriggs.org/myers-and-briggs-foundation/ethical-use-of-the-mbti-instrument/trademark-guidelines.htm)
* If you want more info [this quora answer does a pretty good job of summing it up](https://www.quora.com/To-what-extent-is-the-Myer-Briggs-Type-Indicator-bullshit)



## But Not Entirely ##

* It's an interesting system of classification
* Most importantly, MBTI roughly describes human behavior in a way that makes sense to awkward people, particularly computer scientists
