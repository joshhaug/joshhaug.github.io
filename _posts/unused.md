So... what am I looking for? Here's some examples:

This table is from the great paper *Remote Beehive Monitoring using Acoustic Signals*. [1]

The table fails to mention that worker piping [also occurs in non-disturbed queenright hives](https://www.apidologie.org/articles/apido/pdf/1996/01/Apidologie_0044-8435_1996_27_1_ART0002.pdf).

All my code is available [on github] if you'd like to do this kind of data colletion yourself. I have also published my python notebooks if you'd like to take a look at how I did the basic data analysis.

### Ideas for Stuff

- Pics of setup

- Sonogram of signal to show harmonics

- Non-hive sounds interference

- Commercial hive montioring tools
  
  - [Broodminder](https://broodminder.com) Blutetooth LE devices
  
  - [Arnia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZoRyeiV7BSE) setup

- Amateur tools
  
  - [Temperature and humidity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hl_YaXvU0A)

# Bee Communication

Bees have an amazing sense of smell. It's estimated to be roughly 50 times more sensitive than that of a dog. So it makes sense that bees communicate via pheromone.

I feel this urge to find inefficiencies and iron them out. After all, that's what most problems are in undergrad and grad-level CS courses are all about. "Here's a thing, why is it inefficient?" But when making prototypes, that urge must be resisted for as long as possible. Because the price of an optimal solution is (usually) paid in complexity. And in the early stages of a project, the last thing I want to be thinking about is some complex thing.
