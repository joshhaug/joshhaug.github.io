<p><strong>Slopes is the app for people who want to learn (or teach) differential equations.</strong></p>

<p>Slopes numerically solves arbitrarily large systems of ODEs. It can dynamically plot vector fields for systems of one (slopefield) or two (phase plane) differential equations. It knows several approximation methods (Euler’s, 2nd and 4th order Runge-Kutta) and can compare them for you.  Slopes can simulate your constant coefficient second-order equations as a mass-spring system and a resistor-inductor-capacitor (RLC) circuit.  You can export graphs (pdf, png, etc),</p>

I wrote this app in collaboration with Dr. Timothy Lucas, who is a professor of mathematics at Pepperdine. He likes to say that each of us is 55% responsible for Slopes.

<h1 id="activities">Activities</h1>

<p>Slopes consists of five activities.</p>

<ol>
  <li>“Slopefields” and</li>
  <li>“Phase Planes” both plot vector fields and solutions corresponding to multiple initial conditions.</li>
  <li>“Systems” dynamically solves systems of up to six equations.</li>
  <li>“Waves” solves second-order constant coefficient equations animates the corresponding spring-mass system or RLC circuit.</li>
  <li>“Methods” constructs numerical approximations of a single ordinary differential equation using Euler’s method as well as Second and Fourth Order Runge-Kutta methods.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="slopefields">Slopefields</h2>

<p>The slopefields activity allows you to plot a family of solutions to a single differential equation y’ = f(t,y).  The slope of an arrow located at the point (t,y) is given by f(t,y) and indicates the trajectory of a solution to the differential equation through that point.  The slopefield of a differential equation gives useful information about the general trends and stability of the solutions.  You can resize the window using pinch and pull gestures as well as add solutions by tapping on a point within the graph.  Enter your own equation or explore one of the preloaded equations.</p>

<h2 id="phase-planes">Phase planes</h2>

<p>The phase planes activity allows you to plot a family of solutions to a system of two differential equations  x’ = f(x,y) and y’ = g(x,y).   The phase plane of a system gives a picture of how the solution y varies with respect to x which will allow you to see general trends and stability of the solutions. The slope of an arrow located at the point (x,y) is given by g(x,y)/f(x,y) and indicates the trajectory of a solution to the system through that point.  You can add solutions by tapping on a point within the graph   and the corresponding solutions x(t) and y(t) will appear in the small window in the lower left corner.  Watch an animation that traces the x(t) and y(t) solutions and the corresponding curve in the x-y plane. Enter your own system of equations or explore one of the preloaded systems.</p>

<h2 id="systems">Systems</h2>

<p>The systems activity allows you to plot the solutions to a system of up to six ordinary differential equations.  The initial condition for each equation can be input just to the right of the equation.  This activity is different from phase planes because it allows you the equations to explicitly depend on the independent variable t as well as the dependent variables x,y,z,u,v and w. You can resize the window using pinch and pull gestures as well as extend the solutions by panning with a single finger.  Enter your own equations or explore one of the preloaded systems.</p>

<h2 id="waves">Waves</h2>

<p>The waves activity allows you to plot the solutions to a second order differential equation with constant coefficients.  Since many of these equations can be interpreted as a spring-mass system or RLC circuit, the activity includes simulations that correspond to the solutions.
You can resize the window using pinch and pull gestures as well as extend the solutions by panning with a single finger.  Enter your own forcing term or explore one of the preloaded equations.</p>

<h2 id="methods">Methods</h2>

<p>The methods activity allows you to plot numerical approximations to the solution of an ordinary differential equation y’=f(t,y).  The methods employed in this activity are Euler’s Method as well as Second and Fourth Order Runge-Kutta.  The activity includes a table of the approximations that correspond to each method.  You can easily toggle between the different methods as well as resize the window using pinch and pull gestures.  Enter your own equation or explore one of the preloaded equations.</p>
