<p>I found some ceiling fans in the dumpster next to my apartment.  The types of
motors that come from ceiling fans are usually</p>

<ul>
  <li>quiet</li>
  <li>low torque</li>
  <li>low speed</li>
  <li>coil in rotor</li>
</ul>

<p>single phase induction motors
also known as split phase induction motors
also known as fractional kilowatt motors</p>

<p>For sanding applications the low torque is not a problem.  More often than not
Iâ€™ve found conventional disk sanders to be too agressive.  A slip of the hand
can marr the work.  But with a low-torque motor, the feed rate must be kept
slow to keep the disk spinning. Rather than damage the work, the sander will
just stop.</p>
