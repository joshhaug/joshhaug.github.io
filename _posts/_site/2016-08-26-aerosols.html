<div class="message">
The differences between <b>aerosols</b>, <b>vapors</b>, and <b>gases</b> are subtle, to say the least.  In fact, the differences are practically invisible to the naked eye. Here I clarify those differences, answer common questions, and address popular misconceptions.

  <li>Different processes of generation, different behaviors, different effects on our lungs, etc.</li>
  <li>Clarifies the differences between e-cigarettes, herbal vaporizers, and combustion</li>
  <li>The confusion is amplified by the e-cigarette industry’s use of terms for marketing that are not congruent with the science.</li>
  <li>Gives scientists a clue on how to allow scientific jargon to evolve
    <ul>
      <li>Vapor redefinition to the gaseous phase or suspension of a liquid</li>

<hr />

<p>When you boil a pot of water on the stove, you’ll see a plume of <strong>steam</strong>.  However, water vapor is itself <a href="http://www.weatherquestions.com/What_is_water_vapor.htm">invisible!</a></p>

<p>What e-cigarettes produce: aerosol (suspension of small droplets of propylene glycol + nicotine solution + flavoring solution)</p>

<p>What herbal vaporization produces: aerosol (small droplets of trichomes)</p>

<p>What combustion produces: 
Solid and Liquid Aerosol</p>

<p>How are droplets suspended in the air?</p>

<h3 id="aerosol-categorization">Aerosol Categorization</h3>

<p>Aerosols can be categorized by the measure of particle heterogeneity.  For instance, an aerosol can be <strong>monodisperse</strong> (all particles the same size – this one is very rare in nature) or <strong>polydisperse</strong> (many different sizes).</p>

<p>In this post I’ll be covering polydisperse aerosols, as they are the most common.  It’s useful to describe polydisperse aerosols in terms of their particle size makeup (i.e. divide the total size range into intervals and find the percent of particles that fall within each interval.)  The two most common size intervals you’ll find in literature are PM-10 and PM-2.5.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>PM-10</strong> is an abbreviation for “Particulate Matter of Aerodynamic Diameter ≤ 10.0 µm.”  These particles deposit in the mouth, throat, and upper parts of the lungs.</li>
  <li><strong>PM-2.5</strong> is therefore an abbreviation for “Particulate Matter of Aerodynamic Diameter ≤ 2.5 µm.”  These particles are in the danger zone, so to speak – they are small enough to reach the alveolar region of the lungs, where they can be effortlessly absorbed into the bloodstream.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="deposition">Deposition</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Deposition is the process by which aerosol particles deposit themselves on solid surfaces.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The most common causes of deposition in human lungs are…</p>

<ul>
  <li>Impaction — some particles are unable to follow the curvature of the airflow due to their inertia, so they are flung out of the airstream and hit something</li>
  <li>Settling (aka gravitational sedimentation) — particles fall and settle due to gravity</li>
  <li>Diffusiophoresis — spontaneous movement of particles caused by a concentration gradient</li>
</ul>

<p>Other (not significant in respiratory system) deposition causes include…</p>

<ul>
  <li>Interception — when following the streamline, some of the outermost particles will run into obstacles (note the difference between this and impaction, which is the result of a curvature in the air path)</li>
  <li>Turbulence — I don’t know this one, but read it somewhere.</li>
  <li>Thermophoresis - (aka thermodiffusion, thermomigration, the Soret effect, the Ludwig-Soret effect) movement of particles due to a temperature gradient</li>
  <li>Turbophoresis — tendency for particles to collect in the area of least turbulence</li>
  <li>Electrophoresis - movement of particles induced by a uniform electric field</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="respiratory-deposition">Respiratory Deposition</h3>

<p>The diameter of the particle dₚ determines the region in which it will deposit.  Size-selective sampling is generally split into the following categories:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Inhalable fraction: enters the nose, mouth, pharynx, larynx (dₚ &gt; 10.0 µm)</li>
  <li>Thoracic fraction: reaches the thorax/chest region, trachea to terminal bronchioles, corresponding to PM-10  (dₚ ≤ 10.0 µm)</li>
  <li>Respirable fraction: reaches the alveolar/pulmonary region, corresponding to PM-2.5  (dₚ ≤ 2.5 µm)</li>
</ul>

<p>The most important mechanisms of deposition in the respiratory system are impaction, settling, and diffusion.  Impaction is of primary concern in the large airways.  Settling is most important in the smaller airways and alveolar region.</p>

<h3 id="aerosol-behavior">Aerosol Behavior</h3>

<p>In practice, aerosolized particles may not be spherical.  However, one can approximate a non-spherical particle’s depositional behavior by calculating an <strong>aerodynamic diameter</strong>.  This is done by pretending that the irregular particle (with settling velocity s) is spherical, keeping the settling velocity constant.  This idealized particle is assumed to have a standard particle density of 1000 kg/m<sup>3</sup>.  The diameter of this new particle is defined as…</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">d_{a} = d_{e}\left(\frac{\rho_{p}}{\rho_{0}\chi}\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}</script>

<p>where $\rho_{0}$ is the standard particle density and $\chi$ is the dynamic shape factor (a ratio of the resistive force of an irregular particle to that of a spherical particle).</p>
