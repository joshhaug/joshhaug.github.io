<p>Different wood finishes provide different levels of protection and grain enhancement. In other words, each wood finish has its strengths and weaknesses. Some use cases call for a specific finish.</p>

<p>This is the bullet-points version of the info in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFwWrAq47io">this video</a> on YouTube.</p>

<h3 id="stain">Stain</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Change the color of wood while leaving the grain visible</li>
  <li>Doesn’t offer much protection</li>
  <li>Add mineral spirits to dilute or add multiple coats to intensify</li>
  <li>Apply with a paint brush or cloth</li>
  <li>Dries quickly</li>
  <li>Raises the grain, so sand lightly in between coats</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="oil">Oil</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Brings out the natural beauty of wood</li>
  <li>Protect against moisture but are nowhere near as effective as, say, varnish or shellac</li>
  <li>Lots of types, including…
    <ul>
      <li>Boiled linseed oil
        <ul>
          <li>Cheap, good for decorative things that don’t require much protection (like a picture frame)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Teak oil</li>
      <li>Tung oil</li>
      <li>Mineral oil
        <ul>
          <li>Food-safe, so good for items like chopping boards or spoons</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Danish oil
        <ul>
          <li>Offers more protection than other oils, b/c is a mixture of oil and varnish</li>
          <li>Good for things that require protection, like a tabletop</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Plastic coating for wood</li>

      <li>oil-based (dries slowly, beautifies the wood)</li>
