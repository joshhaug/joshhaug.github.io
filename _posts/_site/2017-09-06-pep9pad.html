<p>Pep9Pad is the newest version of the well-known Pep/9 virtual machine,
designed specifically for use on mobile platforms.  The app features
a small CISC custom assembler, interactive debugger, CPU simulator, and
a small operating system (complete with a loader and trap handler for
unimplemented opcodes) burned into simulated ROM.</p>

<p>The Pep/9 computer is a 16-bit complex instruction set computer (CISC). It
was designed by Dr. Stan Warford to teach computer architecture and
assembly language programming principles. It features 39 instructions and
eight addressing modes, designed for straighforward translation between
C/C++ and assembly language.</p>
