Last year I made some hive boxes. I just measured the dimensions from store-bought ones and duplicated them, with one important exception: **I didn't make their dumb, stupid, idiot, piece of crap loser handles.** Seriously, those recessed handles are garbage. 

Consider the following: A fully-loaded deep super can weigh up to 70 pounds. In gloved hands, that half-inch finger grip isn't gonna cut it. Often, it's easier to pick these hives up from the bottom. 

The ergronomics of picking up hive boxes.

Am I a hero for putting a larger handle on hive boxes? Yes, I am. 

![Am I a hero? I suppose. A maverick? Sure, ](../assets/big-handle.jpg)Am I a genius? Sure, why not. The greatest american hero who ever lived? That's taking it too far.
