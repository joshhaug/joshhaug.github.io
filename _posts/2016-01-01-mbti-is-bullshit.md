title: MBTI© is Junk Science
---

Here's a question I get asked from time to time: 

> Why does it matter what my Myers-Briggs type is?   

It's often followed by this, usually in a hushed voice:

> You know it's bullshit, right?

Go ahead and perform a web search with `MBTI bullshit` as the query.  You'll find *plenty* of people fuming over the MBTI© for a myriad of reasons.  The most common of these are...

1. **Weak factual basis**
  * Neither Isabel Briggs Myers nor Katherine Briggs had a formal background in psychology
  * Based on binary characteristics, which is too restrictive for personality
  * Jung's [analytic psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_psychology) is based on anecdotal rather than empirical evidence, and is therefore unscientific

2. **The tests don't work**
  * Most people get a different result upon re-taking the test [^fn-half-diff]
  * Forces people into one of 16 boxes (which seems arbitrary)
  * Doesn't effectively predict job performance [^fn-job-perf]

3. ****
  * Reinforces stereotypes of personality
  * Seems like a scam
  * MBTI Trust® has trademarked Myers-Briggs Type Indicator®, Myers Briggs®, and MBTI®.  [Here are their guidelines for usage.](http://www.myersbriggs.org/myers-and-briggs-foundation/ethical-use-of-the-mbti-instrument/trademark-guidelines.htm)
  * Moreover, the bulk of scientific literature pertaining to MBTI is published for conferences of the *Center for the Application of Psychological Type* or as papers in the *Journal of Psychological Type*, both of which are funded by sales of MBTI-related tests and services.  

When stacked up, these arguments are pretty convincing.

## The Importance of Helpful Bullshit ##

While I totally agree that MBTI is *not* legitimate science, I disagree with 

And that is precisely what should happen to MBTI -- it should be demoted.  The scientific community and Fortune 500 companies alike should respect the evidence.

In fact, the majority of the population has little need for personality categorization.  

There is a small minority for whom MBTI serves a valuable purpose.  In the Big 5, these are called BLANK and BLANK.  MBTI classifies them as INTPs and INTJs.  

* Classifying people's personalities is inherently ambiguous
* Fuels navel-gazing-and-elitism[^fn-then-again]

* It's an interesting system of classification
* Most importantly, MBTI crudely describes human behavior in a way that makes sense to awkward people (INTP and INTJ then INFs, ENT, ENF, everyone else) (Dylan 2016)

I am an INTP. **INTP**s constitute 3-5% of the U.S. population.[^fn-type-freq]  INTPs share some bizarre quirks like a fondness for discordant music and a strong suspicion towards their own emotions.  For more information, see [An INTP Profile](http://www.intp.org/intprofile.html) by Paul James.  

Here are some INTP sites I'm familiar with:

* [INTP subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/intp)
* [intp.org](http://www.intp.org) has a few cool resources
* [intpexperience.com](http://www.intpexperience.com) goes into depth about the INTP's relationship with emotion

Most online personality forums seem to share the masturbatory "nobody understands us" mentality.  These are no exception -- you've been warned.  Unlike other forums, however, many commenters express sincere gratitude for the typology.  INTPs often have a hell of a time finding others that they can relate to.
