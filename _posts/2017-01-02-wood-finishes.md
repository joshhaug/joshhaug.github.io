title: Wood Finishes, Summarized
---

If you have ever visited the wood finishing aisle at your local hardware store, you're probably familiar with the sheer volume of options.
To a newcomer, these options all _sound_ familiar and seem to be the same thing.  However, different wood finishes provide different protections and have different effects on the appearance of your final project.

### Stain
* Change the color of wood while leaving the grain visible
* Doesn‚Äôt offer much protection
* Add mineral spirits to dilute or add multiple coats to intensify
* Apply with a paint brush or cloth
* Dries quickly
* Raises the grain, so sand lightly in between coats

### Oil
* Brings out the natural beauty of wood
* Protect against moisture but are nowhere near as effective as, say, varnish or shellac
* Lots of types, including‚Ä¶
    * Boiled linseed oil
        * Cheap, good for decorative things that don‚Äôt require much protection (like a picture frame)
    * Teak oil
    * Tung oil
    * Mineral oil
        * Food-safe, so good for items like chopping boards or spoons
    * Danish oil
        * Offers more protection than other oils, b/c is a mixture of oil and varnish
        * Good for things that require protection, like a tabletop

### Polyurethane
* Plastic coating for wood
* Variants include‚Ä¶ 
    * water-based (dries quickly, doesn‚Äôt beautify the wood)
    * oil-based (dries slowly, beautifies the wood)
* Most durable finish
* Leaves a plastic-y feel to it

### Varnish
* Made of oils, resins, solvents
* Dries slowly
* Brings out natural beauty
* Durable, although not as much as polyurethane

### Laquer
* A thin, liquid varnish that is usually sprayed
* Durable
* Dries quickly
* Can be polished
* Brings out natural beauty in the wood


### Shellac
* Glossy finish
* Dries quickly
* Easy to apply
* Often used on antiques and fine furniture
* Not as durable as varnish/poly
* Dulls with age


### Finishing Wax/Beeswax
* Protects against moisture (indoors only)
* Brings out beauty
* Leaves a smooth finish
* Can be polished
* Clear or colored variants available
* Apply sparingly with a cloth in a circular motion
* Can be re-applied as needed
* Can‚Äôt use another finish after wax
